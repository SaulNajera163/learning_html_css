      <h1>What does Relative Position mean?</h1>
      <p>
        Remember it's just the form that we want to move elements and how we
        need to distribute and take referents as a father for the other
        elements. In easy words with Position <strong>Relative</strong> the
        place is reserved, the element can be moving for all the display but
        it's space never be occupied for other element and more important, it's
        measures as margin, padding is gonna taking refers for it's space/place
        even the element is not in it's place. 
      </p>
      <h3>Easy Words</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">When we use relative position we're saying "Ey browser please occupied this place and I'm going to move based in this position and I can move on in the 5 directions top, bottom, left, right and z-index to indicate who is more important and is gonna move to the front layer. And Remember, any element or block that is relative is gonna be make as a relationship with other element that is gonna be absolute obviously the element is inside the relative element.</p>
