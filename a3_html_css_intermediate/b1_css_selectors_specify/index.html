      <h1>Which Cloud is better for our own requirements?</h1>
      <p>
        When a company wants to move on to AWS, they must consider factors such
        as required Cloud application components, preferred resource management
        tools, and any legacy IT infrastructure requirements.

        <h2>Cloud-Based Deployment (All on the Cloud)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Definition: All parts of the application run in the Cloud, with no
            on-premises infrastructure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Example: Hosting virtual servers, databases, and networking
            exclusively in AWS without any on-premises hardware.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
          On-Premises Deployment (All in my data center but some tools from AWS)
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Definition: You keep everything in your own data center (on
            premises) while using technologies such as virtualization and
            resource management.
          </li>
          <li>
            Example: Running applications entirely inside a company’s local data
            center, possibly with virtual machines to manage resources more
            efficiently.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Hybrid Deployment (My data center and AWS together)</h2>
        <p>
          Definition: A mix of both on-premises infrastructure and Cloud-based
          resources.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cloud resources connect to on-premises systems, allowing you to keep
            some apps or data locally while benefiting from Cloud services for
            others.
          </li>
          <li>
            Useful for scenarios with legacy applications that are not easily
            migrated, or for compliance requirements that mandate certain data
            remain on premises.
          </li>

        <h2>Scaling Amazon EC2</h2>
        <p>
          It is not so difficult to know the exactly amount is gonna be
          necessary in a journey day in your system, you can buy all to always
          have resources and when any request is in the peak, you can handle
          them, but you’re wasting money because this peak is just un a little
          bit time, but if you do not the resources necessaries is a bad notice
          because your system is gonna lost customers, so how Can we resolve?
        </p>

        <div>
          <h3 class="header__three" id="header__three__id">Scalability</h3>
          <p>
            The ability to increase or decrease resources to accommodate
            workload demands.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Key Idea: More capacity is added as demand grows, ensuring
              applications continue to perform well.
            </li>
            <li>
              Example: A company running an online store increases the number of
              EC2 instances during a major sales event like Black Friday.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div></div>
        <h3 id="header__three__id">Elasticity</h3>
        <p>
          The ability to automatically scale resources both up and down in
          response to real-time demand.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Key Idea:</strong>Resources expand when needed and shrink when
          demand decreases, preventing waste and optimizing cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong>A news website experiences a traffic spike
          due to breaking news, automatically adding more servers, then reducing
          them as traffic slows.
