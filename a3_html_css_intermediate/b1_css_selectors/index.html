      <h1>Which Cloud is better for our own requirements?</h1>
      <p>
        When a company wants to move on to AWS, they must consider factors such
        as required Cloud application components, preferred resource management
        tools, and any legacy IT infrastructure requirements.

        <h2>Cloud-Based Deployment (All on the Cloud)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Definition: All parts of the application run in the Cloud, with no
            on-premises infrastructure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Example: Hosting virtual servers, databases, and networking
            exclusively in AWS without any on-premises hardware.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
          On-Premises Deployment (All in my data center but some tools from AWS)
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Definition: You keep everything in your own data center (on
            premises) while using technologies such as virtualization and
            resource management.
          </li>
          <li>
            Example: Running applications entirely inside a company’s local data
            center, possibly with virtual machines to manage resources more
            efficiently.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Hybrid Deployment (My data center and AWS together)</h2>
        <p>
          Definition: A mix of both on-premises infrastructure and Cloud-based
          resources.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cloud resources connect to on-premises systems, allowing you to keep
            some apps or data locally while benefiting from Cloud services for
            others.
          </li>
          <li>
            Useful for scenarios with legacy applications that aren’t easily
            migrated, or for compliance requirements that mandate certain data
            remain on premises.
          </li>
