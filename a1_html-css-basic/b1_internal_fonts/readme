Here you need to be so careful because this is an "easy" form to apply all your
fonts but is not the most recommendable; you need to add just the necessary, and here in this example is the correct option because you needed just 400 and 700, and just these were added, but it is more clear when you download the necessary fonts because in this format, the fonts are brought from Google servers and is a big enterprise, but maybe one day the path can be different and the link is going to break, so it is better to have your own font with different styles and weights in the server, in the host, and never lose the access, but you need to download the font later setting them.
