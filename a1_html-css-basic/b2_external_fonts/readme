Here I'll download the font, but we need to save it here in the code. I mean, like CSS, JS, and Python code, we are going to use the static path to use the font in the project. 

Steps

1.- Download the font

2.- Move the file "static," rename it to "fonts," and save it in a new file "font," and here is where all our fonts live.

3.- Create the "font.css" file to create all our new fonts because until here we just saved the fonts but never set them.

4. This is the architecture:

@font-face{
    font-family: "Montserrat";
    src: url(../font/fonts/Montserrat-Regular.ttf) format(truetype);
    font-weight: 400;
}

5.- Call the new fonts in your style.css file.
