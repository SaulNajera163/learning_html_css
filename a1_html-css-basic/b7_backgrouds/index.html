    <h1>You can use cover or contain</h1>
    <p>
      choose it when the image itself is critical (logos, diagrams,
      screenshots). The browser scales the graphic so the whole thing fits in
      the box without cropping. You may see blank bands if the aspect ratios
      differ, but every pixel remains visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      use it for decorative or atmospheric images (hero banners, card
      thumbnails). The browser enlarges the picture until the box is completely
      filled; if the aspect ratios don’t match, the extra area is clipped,
      hiding whatever falls outside the box edges
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Must see the whole image? → contain</li>
      <li>Must fill the space, cropping is fine? → cover</li>
      <li><strong>If you use cover, doesn't need bg-repeat</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <div class="box">
      <p>This space is 'cause we use contain and put in all the image and it won't crop it</p>
    </div>
