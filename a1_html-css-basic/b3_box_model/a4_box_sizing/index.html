      <h1>What is border-sizing?</h1>
      <h2>In this case both are the same measures but one with content-box and border-box</h2>
      <p>Like the name says, this is just the form that each browser is gonna applied the width and height but at the same time padding, margin and border because if you use the basic form <strong>content box</strong> the box is gonna grow although you design width and height. </p> 

      <div class="content-box"></div>

      <hr>

    
      <p>Box-sizing using the optio border-box you gonna created a static space I mean, if you one a container with 100 measure in the width and 120 in height, this is gonna be the same measure although you applied 200 in padding or border.</p>
