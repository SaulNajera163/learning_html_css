      <p class="exp__paragraph">
        It's so easy, flex comes with flexibility and is normal that maybe in a
        200px at with we can save 5 element but each element is around 50px so
        in this case we'll reach a point when the element is going to be smaller
        but we can applied a properties to maintain the same value as box-sizing
        with border-box so is easy to understand.
      </p>
      <h1>Flex-Flow</h1>
      <p class="exp__paragraph">
        It's just the short form to use flex-direction and later the flex-wrap
        form.
