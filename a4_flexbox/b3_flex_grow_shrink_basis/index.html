        <p class="paragraph">
          It's just the form in how you gonna distribute the space per element,
          in this case we have 7 pieces, the first with 1, second with 2 and the
          three with 4, and your gonna take the container, cut in 7 pieces and
          distribute based on the flex-grow.
          <br />
          Works best when you do not set a fixed width on the flex items. If you
          set width or max-width, you limit how much the items can grow.
          <span>
            Note: If you have a specific width with px, this not gonna be
            applied, just for min/max and auto.
            <br />
            Based on the free space!
